## ðŸ“– Overview
The Request for Proposal Handling Tool (RFQ Opening Process) is a versatile solution designed for businesses and organizations that handle requests for quotations regularly. It streamlines the RFQ process, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and accountability at each stage. This tool is ideal for procurement teams, suppliers, and organizations looking to improve their RFQ processes.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- Setup of RFQ opening committees
- Set closing dates for RFQ
- Secure and transparent supplier quotation opening process

## ðŸ›  Technical Stack and Setup Instructions
The tool is built on the robust and flexible Empress platform, ensuring seamless integration with your existing systems.
